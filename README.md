# Memoize

The goal of this project was to build an app that could act as an educational tool for a web development topic. The concept behind my app was that there are an overwhelming amount of string, array, and object methods in javascript to someone who is new to coding. Each with their own special abilities that you might not have to use everyday. I wanted to create a flashcard system where the user could quickly go through methods they were still learning while ignoring the ones they feel comfortable with. This could also be used before going into a technical interview as a quick refresher on what all the methods do and how they act.
